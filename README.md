# GifTastic
nw bootcamp week 6 assignment 

The point of this exercise is to be able to display certain GIFs based on the button that you click.

Every time you click a button, 10 images will populate the window. You will notice that these images
are not animated. This is on purpose!

Once you click on any image, it will magically start moving! :o

Click it again and it will stop! :x

You can add your own images by typing in the text input box and selecting submit.
Then click on the button with your search term and BOOM!

Have fun and get creative!
